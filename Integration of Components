Integrating a Designed Antenna into the Comparison Method/Drone Method
	Comparison Method is designated for a 3 antenna system.  The Parameters of the transmitting antenna (Antenna 1) and the designed antenna 
  (Antenna 3) are known.  The receiver of the system will be coupled with reference and designed Antenna.  
  The power received by both antennas, can be derived to find the gain of the Antenna under the test.  
  Accuracy of the Comparison method is closely related to the directivity of the antenna, given that in order to get the best reception, 
  and measurements, the antenna of the system must be directed on each other for the best performance.  
  his tedious testing will consume much time by trail-end-error, which is not ideal for the timeline of this project.
 
	In order to save time, effort, and reduce cost, the system can be integrated using an autonomous drone, and an
  omni-directional antenna with known parameters.   These components can be integrated into the system, to reduce 
  the effects of directivity in the radiation pattern of the antenna (for isotropic sources Directivity is often at unity).   
  This new approach using a drone, with an omni-directional antenna will improve the system in various ways; 
  
1.	The Radiation pattern measurements can be stored, and visualized after each simulations, furthermore after many successful simulations the measurements can be averaged to calculate the parameters of the antenna.

2.	Since the Designed antenna has been modelled, simulation results will allow improved understanding of the antenna operation and parameters.

3. 	Autonomists behavior of the system, reduces the complexity, allowing Non-Technical individuals to operate and simulate the system, while improving their understanding.
